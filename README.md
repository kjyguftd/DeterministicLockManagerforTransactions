# DeterministicLockManagerforETHTransactions

## Introduction
This project implements a deterministic lock manager for Ethereum transactions. It ensures that transactions are executed in a consistent and predictable order.

## Features
- **Deterministic Locking Mechanism**: Ensures that transactions are executed in a consistent and predictable order, reducing the chances of conflicts and deadlocks.
- **Support for Concurrent Transactions**: Allows multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously without compromising the integrity of the transaction order.
- **High Performance and Scalability**: Designed to handle a high volume of transactions efficiently, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Implements advanced algorithms to detect and resolve conflicts between transactions automatically.
- **Customizable Lock Policies**: Provides options to define custom lock policies based on the specific requirements of your application.
- **Extensive Logging and Monitoring**: Includes comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities to help track transaction processing and diagnose issues.
- **Flexible Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing systems and supports multiple interfaces for seamless interaction with other components.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Ensures that errors are properly managed and that the system can recover gracefully from unexpected issues.

## Installation
To install the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kjyguftd/DeterministicLockManagerforTransactions.git
cd DeterministicLockManagerforTransactions
go mod tidy
```

## Usage
To use the lock manager, import the module and create an instance:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/kjyguftd/DeterministicLockManagerforTransactions/lockmanager"
)

func main() {
    lockManager := lockmanager.NewLockManager()

    // Example usage
    lockManager.Lock(transactionId, func() {
        // Execute transaction
    })
}
```
